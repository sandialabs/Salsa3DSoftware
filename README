Salsa3DSoftware is a suite of applications that facilitate interaction with
the Salsa3D seismic velocity model (https://www.sandia.gov/salsa3d/).

To obtain, build and configure the software:
1) clone the code from github at 
   https://github.com/sandialabs/Salsa3DSoftware
2) cd into the Salsa3DSoftware directory and build using maven:
   mvn clean package
3) run ./configure.sh script which will create run scripts for
   pcalc, locoo3d, geotess, and geotessbuilder.
4) Edit your .bash_profile or .cshrc file as recommended by 
   the configure script.

Salsa3DSoftware includes the following applications:

PCalc - a software tool for extracting information from seismic velocity 
   models, including:
    - velocity profiles, transects and grid, 
    - predictions of travel time, uncertainty, and more,
    - ray path geometries.

LocOO3D - a seismic event location application capable of basing 
   travel time predictions on the Salsa3D velocity model.
   
GeoTessJava - a model parameterization and software support system 
   that implements the construction, population, storage and interrogation 
   of data stored in 3D Earth models. 

GeoTessBuilder is a tool to build custom GeoTessGrids.
