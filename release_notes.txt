Salsa3DSoftware Release Notes

Version 1.2025.3 - released Wednesday April 28, 2025

	1.  Fixed a bug in locoo3d that occurred when writing out origerr results 
		when epicenter and depth fixed; only time free.
	2.	Implemented ability compute infrasound travel time predictions using
		a 2D, distance-depth, model instead of the radial2D model usually used.
	3.	In RSTT, made the properties more flexible.  Most can now be accessed as 
		rstt_property in addition to the standard slbm_property.

Version 1.2023.6 - released Friday October 3, 2023

	1.	Fixed bug in LibCorr3D that prevented properties maxSiteSeparation and
		matchOnRefSta from being applied.
	2.	Fixed 2 bugs related to generation of gridded residual plots.
	3.	Code changes to enforce consistent application of EarthShape throughout 
		applications.
	4.	Modifications to some of the LocOO IO classes to facilitate access to LocOO
		from 3rd party applications.

Version 1.2023.5 - released Wednesday July 12, 2023

	1.	Updated users manuals for LocOO3D, PCalc, and GeoTessJava.
	2.	Added capability to GeoTessExplorer to convert LibCorr3D models from
		common-rotated grid configuration to custom grid configuration and 
		vice versa.
	3.	Fixed a bug in LocOO3D that prevented properties gen_defining_phases, 
		gen_defining_attributes, gen_defining_stations and gen_defining_observations_filter
		from operating.

Version 1.2023.4 - released Thursday, March 23, 2023

	1.	Added a feature to SLBMWrapper where predictions computed with the 
		lookup2d predictor are returned when the slbm predictor fails to 
		compute a valid prediction.  The lookup2d predictor usually uses the
		ak135 model.  This feature is turned off by default but can be turned on 
		by setting property slbm_backstop_lookup2d = true.

Version 1.2023.3 - released Tuesday, March 21, 2023

	1.	Fixed a bug that populated assoc.timedef, azdef and slodef with incorrect
		values when an observation with invalid predictions was changed from 
		defining to non-defining.
	2.	Fixed some issues with the content of the output logs.

Version 1.2023.2 - released Thursday, March 16, 2023

	1.	Added support for database wallets in LocOO3D and PCalc
	2.	Fixed a bug that prevented event depth constraints based on seismicity 
		depth model from being applied properly.
	3.	Fixed LocOO3D output log file to properly report the uncertainty type
		(distance dependent or path dependent) for the rstt model.
	4.	Added ability to control the content of the assoc.vmodel field when 
		libcorr3d corrections are applied.
	5.	Added synchronization to LibCorr3D class to prevent multiple instances
		from being instantiated.

 
Version 1.2022.5 – released Monday, December 12, 2022

	1.	Version numbers reported by PCalc, LocOO3D and GeoTess now reflect the 
		Salsa3DSoftware version number and not the individual application version 
		numbers as was formerly the case.
	2.	Eliminated SupportMap from the system.  The functionality is now 
		performed on-the-fly by LibCorr3D.  Any references to support maps in 
		PCalc and LocOO3D properties files are now ignored.
	3.	Further improvements in parsing of site information by PCalc and 
		LocOO3D. Flat files containing site information can be populated with 
		strings that result from database queries similar to 
		“select * from site where ….”
	4.	Fixed bug in LocOO3D that affected using master event relocation with 
		flat file input.
	5.	Improved Examples related to PCalc and LibCorr3D

Version 1.2022.4 – released Monday, November 14,  2022
 
	1.	Fixed a bug that prevented supportmap from launching.
	2.	Dramatically reduced the time required to generate SupportMap files. 
		Only applies to LibCorr3D libraries that contain models generated using 
		this or later releases of Salsa3DSoftware.  Patching older LibCorr3D 
		libraries is possible using the GeoTessExlorer reformat method, but has 
		not been implemented.
	3.	Improved methods to parse Site information.  Users can now specify site 
		information in properties files and in pcalc siteFiles using tab 
		delimited or space delimited formats.  If space delimited, quotes around 
		strings are optional.  If site.staname includes internal spaces then 
		quotes around it are required.  In tab delimited format, only sta, lat, 
		lon and elevation are required, all unspecified fields assume default 		
		values.
	4.	Modified the collection of files included in seismic base data.  Before 
		this release, there were files in tt_ak135 and tt_iasp91 for phases 
		that were not represented in el_ak135, resulting in unnecessary error 
		messages (but no exceptions).  
 
Version 1.2022.3 – released Monday, October 31, 2022
 
	1.	Improved computational performance when using lookup2d and rstt 
		predictors.
	2.	Fixed a memory leak.  Applications that use large libraries of 
		libcorr3d surfaces may now have substantially smaller memory footprints.
	3.	When generating many libcorr3d surfaces users can now use a new 
		siteFile property to more conveniently run on multiple computers.  See 
		new appendix C in pcalc user’s manual.
	4.	When generating support map files, and when using libcorr3d surfaces, 
		applications can now specify a support map file other than the default 
		one.
	5.	When generating LibCorr3DModels, Bender will very rarely produce 
		anomalously large values (about once in 106 rays).  These anomalous 
		values are now being identified and repaired when LibCorr3D surfaces are 
		generated.
