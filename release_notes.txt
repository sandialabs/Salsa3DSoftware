Salsa3DSoftware Release Notes

Version 1.2025.8 - released Wednesday January 7, 2026

    1.  Fixed a bug related to caching Bender instances which are not thread-safe.
    2.  Provided access to blockage for Radial2D models and extrapolation 
        information for lookup2d models.
    
Version 1.2025.7 - released Monday December 15, 2025

    1.  Renamed class gov.sandia.gmp.util.numerical.vector.VectorGeo to GeoMath
    2.  Implemented Slowness Azimuth Source Corrections (SASCs) used by the 
        CTBTO International Data Center (IDC)
    3.  Removed option to use the Vincenty method for computing distance and
        azimuth in Radial2D models.  Snyder method, which is used by all other
        Salsa3DSoftware Predictors, is now used in all cases.
    4.  Updated the algorithm used to compute surface wave travel time predictions
        according to instructions from Christos Saragiotis at the IDC.
    5.  Implemented the ability to read 1D travel time models (ak135, iasp91, etc)
        directly from zip files in addition to reading them from normal directories.
        This change is necessary to avoid file name collisions for phases pP, PP, 
        pS, PS, sS, SS and sP, SP, as well as some others. See section C.2.2.2, 
        lookup2dTableDirectory, in the LocOO3D User's Manual for details.

Version 1.2025.6 - released Wednesday August 6, 2025

    1.  Made RSTT thread-safe.
    2.  Improved performance of PredictorFactory by caching Predictors
        as a function of PredictorType and Properties.  
        
Version 1.2025.4 - released Thursday May 15, 2025

    1.  In RSTT, made all properties use prefix 'rstt'.
        Some, but not all, properties can still use 'slbm'
    2.  In Radial2DModels, the use of Vincenty method to compute distance,
        azimuth and backazimuth can now be selected. Default is Snyder method.
    3.  Cleaned up messy code involving travel time model uncertainty
        and tested computing predictions in parallel.  
        
Version 1.2025.3 - released Monday April 28, 2025

    1.  Fixed a bug in locoo3d that occurred when writing out origerr results 
        when epicenter and depth fixed; only time free.
    2.  Implemented ability compute infrasound travel time predictions using
        a 2D, distance-depth, model instead of the radial2D model usually used.
    3.  In RSTT, made the properties more flexible.  Most can now be accessed as 
        rstt_property in addition to the standard slbm_property.  
        
Version 1.2025.2 - released Wednesday April 9, 2025

    1.  Fixed a bug where changing ellipsoid from WGS84 to SPHERE caused
        error when interrogating LiCorr3D models written assuming WGS84.
    2.  Improved design and algorithms for managing Polygons.

        SurfaceWavePredictor.
    2.  Added a LocOO3D constructor that ensures that all earth models
        are loaded into memory only once.
    3.  Fixed bug in LocOO3D to allow master event relocation
        to be applied correctly through the NativeInput class.

Version 1.2023.5 - released Wednesday July 12, 2023

    1.  Updated users manuals for LocOO3D, PCalc, and GeoTessJava.
    2.  Added capability to GeoTessExplorer to convert LibCorr3D models from
        common-rotated grid configuration to custom grid configuration and 
        vice versa.
    3.  Fixed a bug in LocOO3D that prevented properties gen_defining_phases, 
        gen_defining_attributes, gen_defining_stations and gen_defining_observations_filter
        from operating.

Version 1.2023.4 - released Thursday, March 23, 2023

    1.  Added a feature to SLBMWrapper where predictions computed with the 
        lookup2d predictor are returned when the slbm predictor fails to 
        compute a valid prediction.  The lookup2d predictor usually uses the
        ak135 model.  This feature is turned off by default but can be turned on 
        by setting property slbm_backstop_lookup2d = true.

Version 1.2023.3 - released Tuesday, March 21, 2023

    1.  Fixed a bug that populated assoc.timedef, azdef and slodef with incorrect
        values when an observation with invalid predictions was changed from 
        defining to non-defining.
    2.  Fixed some issues with the content of the output logs.

Version 1.2023.2 - released Thursday, March 16, 2023

    1.  Added support for database wallets in LocOO3D and PCalc
    2.  Fixed a bug that prevented event depth constraints based on seismicity 
        depth model from being applied properly.
    3.  Fixed LocOO3D output log file to properly report the uncertainty type
        (distance dependent or path dependent) for the rstt model.
    4.  Added ability to control the content of the assoc.vmodel field when 
        libcorr3d corrections are applied.
    5.  Added synchronization to LibCorr3D class to prevent multiple instances
        from being instantiated.

 
Version 1.2022.5 – released Monday, December 12, 2022

    1.  Version numbers reported by PCalc, LocOO3D and GeoTess now reflect the 
        Salsa3DSoftware version number and not the individual application version 
        numbers as was formerly the case.
    2.  Eliminated SupportMap from the system.  The functionality is now 
        performed on-the-fly by LibCorr3D.  Any references to support maps in 
        PCalc and LocOO3D properties files are now ignored.
    3.  Further improvements in parsing of site information by PCalc and 
        LocOO3D. Flat files containing site information can be populated with 
        strings that result from database queries similar to 
        “select * from site where ….”
    4.  Fixed bug in LocOO3D that affected using master event relocation with 
        flat file input.
    5.  Improved Examples related to PCalc and LibCorr3D

Version 1.2022.4 – released Monday, November 14,  2022
 
    1.  Fixed a bug that prevented supportmap from launching.
    2.  Dramatically reduced the time required to generate SupportMap files. 
        Only applies to LibCorr3D libraries that contain models generated using 
        this or later releases of Salsa3DSoftware.  Patching older LibCorr3D 
        libraries is possible using the GeoTessExlorer reformat method, but has 
        not been implemented.
    3.  Improved methods to parse Site information.  Users can now specify site 
        information in properties files and in pcalc siteFiles using tab 
        delimited or space delimited formats.  If space delimited, quotes around 
        strings are optional.  If site.staname includes internal spaces then 
        quotes around it are required.  In tab delimited format, only sta, lat, 
        lon and elevation are required, all unspecified fields assume default         
        values.
    4.  Modified the collection of files included in seismic base data.  Before 
        this release, there were files in tt_ak135 and tt_iasp91 for phases 
        that were not represented in el_ak135, resulting in unnecessary error 
        messages (but no exceptions).  
 
Version 1.2022.3 – released Monday, October 31, 2022
 
    1.  Improved computational performance when using lookup2d and rstt 
        predictors.
    2.  Fixed a memory leak.  Applications that use large libraries of 
        libcorr3d surfaces may now have substantially smaller memory footprints.
    3.  When generating many libcorr3d surfaces users can now use a new 
        siteFile property to more conveniently run on multiple computers.  See 
        new appendix C in pcalc user’s manual.
    4.  When generating support map files, and when using libcorr3d surfaces, 
        applications can now specify a support map file other than the default 
        one.
    5.  When generating LibCorr3DModels, Bender will very rarely produce 
        anomalously large values (about once in 106 rays).  These anomalous 
        values are now being identified and repaired when LibCorr3D surfaces are 
        generated.
