Salsa3DSoftware Release Notes
Updated Saturday, February 18, 2023

Version 1.2022.5.2 - released Monday, February 27th, 2023
	Added python wrappers in python directory and notebooks to run python wrappers
	in Examples/Notebooks

	Added data for Examples/Notebooks in Examples/data

 
Version 1.2022.5.1 – released Saturday, February 18, 2023

	Fixed a bug that prevented event depth constraints based on seismicity depth
	model from being applied properly.

Version 1.2022.5 – released Monday, December 12, 2022

	1.	Version numbers reported by PCalc, LocOO3D and GeoTess now reflect the 
		Salsa3DSoftware version number and not the individual application version 
		numbers as was formerly the case.
	2.	Eliminated SupportMap from the system.  The functionality is now 
		performed on-the-fly by LibCorr3D.  Any references to support maps in 
		PCalc and LocOO3D properties files are now ignored.
	3.	Further improvements in parsing of site information by PCalc and 
		LocOO3D. Flat files containing site information can be populated with 
		strings that result from database queries similar to 
		“select * from site where ….”
	4.	Fixed bug in LocOO3D that affected using master event relocation with 
		flat file input.
	5.	Improved Examples related to PCalc and LibCorr3D

Version 1.2022.4 – released Monday, November 14,  2022
 
	1.	Fixed a bug that prevented supportmap from launching.
	2.	Dramatically reduced the time required to generate SupportMap files. 
		Only applies to LibCorr3D libraries that contain models generated using 
		this or later releases of Salsa3DSoftware.  Patching older LibCorr3D 
		libraries is possible using the GeoTessExlorer reformat method, but has 
		not been implemented.
	3.	Improved methods to parse Site information.  Users can now specify site 
		information in properties files and in pcalc siteFiles using tab 
		delimited or space delimited formats.  If space delimited, quotes around 
		strings are optional.  If site.staname includes internal spaces then 
		quotes around it are required.  In tab delimited format, only sta, lat, 
		lon and elevation are required, all unspecified fields assume default 		
		values.
	4.	Modified the collection of files included in seismic base data.  Before 
		this release, there were files in tt_ak135 and tt_iasp91 for phases 
		that were not represented in el_ak135, resulting in unnecessary error 
		messages (but no exceptions).  
 
Version 1.2022.3 – released Monday, October 31, 2022
 
	1.	Improved computational performance when using lookup2d and rstt 
		predictors.
	2.	Fixed a memory leak.  Applications that use large libraries of 
		libcorr3d surfaces may now have substantially smaller memory footprints.
	3.	When generating many libcorr3d surfaces users can now use a new 
		siteFile property to more conveniently run on multiple computers.  See 
		new appendix C in pcalc user’s manual.
	4.	When generating support map files, and when using libcorr3d surfaces, 
		applications can now specify a support map file other than the default 
		one.
	5.	When generating LibCorr3DModels, Bender will very rarely produce 
		anomalously large values (about once in 106 rays).  These anomalous 
		values are now being identified and repaired when LibCorr3D surfaces are 
		generated.
 
New features planned for future releases:
 
	1.	Implement output of ar_info flatfiles and database tables. 
	2.	Ensure that Oracle Wallets function properly.
	3.	Include regression tests that can be run to ensure that important 
		functionality still functions.
