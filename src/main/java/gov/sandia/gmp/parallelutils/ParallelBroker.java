/**
 * The base class ParallelBroker object used to handle parallel task submissions in an arbitrary
 * manner. Five different parallel modes are supported including: "sequential", "concurrent",
 * "distributed", "distributed_cuda_sp", and "distributed_cuda_dp". The "sequential" mode is used
 * for debugging purposes only or in rare cases where only one machine with one processor is
 * available for processing. The concurrent mode is used to take advantage of several processors on
 * a single machine. The last three use the Java Parallel Processing Framework (JPPF) to handle many
 * separate nodes (processors) on many distributed machines. A static factory method (create) is
 * defined that allows a user to access any of the above brokers.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Several functions are defined to allow the user to submit tasks, get results, and check on the
 * relative state of the broker (size, empty, processor count, broker type, etc.). All submitted
 * tasks must use the interface ParallelTask. All returned results must use the interface
 * ParallelResults. Tasks must be implemented by the user to perform the specific requirements of
 * the application. Results must be defined to contain the relevant results from each task for
 * return to the application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Nine primary functions are supported including:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>public abstract void submit(List<? extends ParallelTask> tsks);</li>
 * <li>public abstract void submit(ParallelTask tsk);</li>
 * <li>public abstract List<ParallelResult> getResults();</li>
 * <li>public abstract List<ParallelResult> getResultsWait();</li>
 * <li>public abstract ParallelResult getResult();</li>
 * <li>public abstract ParallelResult getResultWait();</li>
 * <li>public abstract int size();</li>
 * <li>public abstract boolean isEmpty();</li>
 * <li>public abstract void close();</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The two submit functions submit an array of tasks or a single entry for processing using one of
 * the modes above. These functions are non- blocking and return immediately.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are four result retrieval functions getResult() and getResultWait() return a single result
 * submitted by one of the first two functions or null if no results are available. The returned
 * result is not necessarily in the order that it was submitted. The functions getResults() and
 * getResultsWait() return all currently available results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The "Wait" version will block and wait for a result if any are pending. The non "Wait" version
 * return null immediately if no results are available. All four functions return null immediately
 * if their are no available results and none pending.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The function size returns the number of results that are or will be available once all results
 * from the submit functions have been processed. The function isEmpty() returns true if no results
 * remain (none are available and none are pending).
 * 
 * <p>
 * The function close cleans up resources used by the CONCURRENT and DISTRIBUTED modes. It performs
 * no action for the SEQUENTIAL mode.
