/**
 * An ordered list of points on the surface of a unit sphere that define a closed polygon.
 * Polygons have the ability to test whether or not an arbitrary test point on the sphere
 * is inside or outside the polygon.
 * 
 * When a polygon is constructed from a list of points, the side of the polygon that is
 * deemed to be 'inside' is ambiguous.  The user could intend that the smaller of the 
 * polygons be 'inside' or that the smaller polygon be 'outside'.  With one exception,
 * all of the polygon constuctors in this class assume that the smaller polygon is 'inside'.  
 * The exception is the constructor that creates a polygon from a center point and a radius.
 * In that case, if the radius is > PI/2, then the larger polygon is deemed to be 'inside'.
 * 
 * If the user wants the larger polygon to be 'inside', they can call method invert(), 
 * which will switch the polygons.
 * 
 * The concept of 'inside' and 'outside' is implemented by having a reference point which 
 * is specified to be either inside or outside the polygon.  Users can specify these 
 * values by calling setReferencePoint().
 * 
 * <p>
 * A convenient mechanism for generating polygons is to use Google Earth. It has the
 * ability to interactively generate polygons and store them in kmz or kml files. Polygon2D
 * has facilities to read and write kmz and kml files. Polygon2D can also read and write
 * polygons to an ascii file. An advantage of the ascii file format is that the position
 * of the reference point and whether the reference point is inside or outside the polygon
 * are stored in the file and therefore can be manipulated by users. For example, if a
 * user wishes to generate a polygon that is larger than a hemisphere, they could define
 * the polygon boundary points with Google Earth but the resulting polygon would be
 * inverted (the inside would be outside and the outside would be inside). They could use
 * Polygon2D to write the polygon to an ascii file,and manually edit the file to modify the
 * reference point definition.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A test point that is located very close to a polygon boundary is deemed to be
 * 'inside' the polygon. This means that if two adjacent, non-overlapping polygons share a
 * boundary point or a boundary edge, a test point near that point or edge will be deemed 
 * to be 'inside' both polygons. In this context two points are 'very close' if they are separated by
 * less than 1e-7 radians or 5.7e-6 degrees. For a sphere with the radius of the Earth
 * (6371 km), this corresponds to a linear distance of about 60 cm.
